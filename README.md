# Comparing the Rate of Teen Births in North Carolina With Georgia
This repository will document the steps necessary to compile a dataset comparing the rate of teen births in North Carolina with the rate in Georgia. Here you will find a Data Compilation Notebook, the County Public Health Dataset from 2014-2015, subsets culled from the data, and graphs visualizing the data. All of this information is available for you to access on the left of the screen, or by clicking on this link to travel to the homepage:

## Why Write This?
The following repository was an assignment for an English 105 course. Completing it not only generates knowledge about coding through Python, it provides a platform to practice documentation of the coding process by writing comprehensible intructions for reproducing the process of creating subsets of data and creating a repository to include said data as well as documents like this README file.

## Should You Read On?
This repository should primarily be explored by those interested in studying correlations between an individuals actions and the impact of said actions on society, the economy, etc. Social and data scientists are most likely to study these datasets, but any other interested parties are welcome to read on.

## Why Does This Data Matter?

Studying the rates of teen births can lead to a better understanding of how they impact economic and social factors. The CDC has found that teen pregnancy and childbirth significantly contribute to the dropouts of high school girls. In order to analyze the causes of teen births in greater depth, comparing the rates in different states could provide useful information about potential factors increasing or decreasing these rates.

## How Was The Data Collected?
Navigate to the **Data** folder to find the original dataset that was used to create the subsets used in this repository -- it will be titled **CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv**. The aforementioned subsets will be in the same folder titled **Data_Subset**. By using Python, I selected specific data from the County Public Health Dataset that compared teen birth rates in North Carolina with the rates in Georgia. By opening the Data Compilation Notebook attatched to this repository, you will be able to recreate the steps that I used to attain the data.

## How To Get Started?
Is your interest peaked? Perfect, in order to get started recreating my data subsets, download the County Public Health Data .cvs file located in the **Data** folder. Once it's downloaded, feel free to open the **Data_Subset** file and explore the datasets used to gather this data, or jump straight to the Data Compilation Notebook in order to follow the instructions and recreate the sets for yourself. *Enjoy!*
