Why Does This Data Matter?

Studying the rates of teen births can lead to a better understanding of how it impacts economic and social factors. The CDC has found that pregnancy and childbirth remain to significantly contribute to the dropouts of high school girls. In order to analyze the causes of teen births in greater depth, comparing the rates in different states could provide useful information about potential factors increasing or decreasing these rates.
